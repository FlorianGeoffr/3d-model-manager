# 3D Model Manager

Self-hosted web app for managing a personal library of 3D-printable models.

- **Library**: STL, 3MF (incl. Bambu Production Extension), OBJ, STEP, IGES, plus sliced `.gcode.3mf`/`.gcode` artifacts
- **Storage**: pluggable backends — local directory, SMB share (userspace client, no privileged container), S3 — human-readable tree, every file content-hashed (blake3); configured/connection-tested from Settings, with a local→X migration helper
- **Scanner**: `scan_library` reconciles the DB against the backend on demand (or on a schedule) — relinks moved folders by hash without re-hashing untouched files, adopts out-of-band folders dropped straight onto the share as draft models, flags genuinely missing files for review; never deletes anything
- **Revisions**: model-level, full snapshot per revision (fast-copied via reflink / SMB COPYCHUNK / S3 CopyObject), hash-diff between revisions
- **Viewing**: server-side normalization to meshopt-compressed GLB; in-browser rotate/zoom/pan viewer; server-rendered thumbnails (f3d) + embedded 3MF plate thumbnails
- **Printing**: send sliced files to a Bambu Lab A1 mini over LAN (Developer Mode: FTPS upload + MQTT start/status)
- **Import**: by URL from Printables, Thingiverse, and (feature-flagged) MakerWorld, with provenance/license capture
- **Stack**: FastAPI + Celery/Redis + PostgreSQL backend; React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/Radix frontend; Docker Compose deployment
- **Processing pipeline**: per-blob background jobs extract mesh/CAD metadata (dims, triangle count, volume) and sliced-file metadata (print time, filament, per-plate previews), convert STL/OBJ/3MF/STEP/IGES to GLB, meshopt-compress it for the browser (`gltfpack`), and render server-side thumbnails (`f3d`) -- covering plain meshes, CAD (via OCCT), and Bambu Production-Extension/sliced `.gcode.3mf` 3MFs
- **Viewer**: in-browser React Three Fiber viewer (orbit/pan/zoom) rendering the compressed GLB, with an automatic decimated LOD for very high-poly meshes
- **Gallery**: cover thumbnails, per-format badges, sliced-file filtering (`has_sliced`) and print-time display, driven by the same processing pipeline

## Status

[![CI](https://github.com/metril/3d-model-manager/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/metril/3d-model-manager/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/metril/3d-model-manager/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/metril/3d-model-manager/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Pre-alpha — under active development. See the spec for the M0–M6 milestone plan.

## Quickstart (Docker Compose)

Requires Docker with the Compose plugin, **v2.24 or newer** (Feb 2024) — the
production overlay uses Compose's `!reset` tag to suppress the from-source
build. Check with `docker compose version`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml pull
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

Adding `-f compose.prod.yaml` is what makes this the *pull* path: the overlay
points every app service at the published
`ghcr.io/metril/3d-model-manager` image instead of building locally. That
matters more than it sounds — a from-source build compiles `gltfpack` from C++
and installs OCCT and `f3d`, which takes **15-25 minutes**. Pulling takes as
long as your connection does.

**Pin a release** rather than tracking `latest`, so an upgrade is something you
choose rather than something that happens to you on the next `up`:

```sh
IMAGE_TAG=v0.1.0 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

`IMAGE_TAG` is read from your shell or from the root `.env` (Compose
auto-loads that file for interpolation), so putting `IMAGE_TAG=v0.1.0` in
`.env` alongside everything else is the tidier option and applies to every
subsequent command without repeating it. Unset, it defaults to `latest`. See
"Releases & versioning" below for what each published tag means.

All five app services — `api`, `worker-io`, `worker-cpu`, `beat`, `printerd` —
run this **one** image; they differ only by the `ROLE` env var and their
`command`. There is nothing to pull per-service.

Confirm what's actually running:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/api/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}
```

The published image is **`linux/amd64` only** for now — an arm64 build is
blocked on an upstream dependency, and [docs/arm64-status.md](docs/arm64-status.md)
records exactly which one and what would unblock it.

### Building from source instead

For development, or on a platform with no published image, omit
`-f compose.prod.yaml` — that alone selects `compose.yaml`'s `build:` blocks:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Expect the 15-25 minute first build described above. Subsequent builds reuse
Docker's layer cache and are much faster.

### What comes up

Either path brings up the same stack.

This starts every service, always — there are no compose profiles to opt
into: `api` (port `8080`), `worker-io` (uploads/store), `worker-cpu` (the
metadata/GLB-conversion/thumbnail pipeline, one process per core,
memory-recycled -- see "Worker split" below), `beat` (ticks the scan/
collection-sync/watched-folder dispatcher), `printerd` (the Bambu LAN MQTT
supervisor), `db` (Postgres 16), and `redis`. `beat` and `printerd` idle
harmlessly when their corresponding features are off in Settings — see
"Scheduled scan" and "Printer integration" below. The api container runs
Alembic migrations on startup, then serves both the JSON API (`/api/...`)
and the built frontend SPA at <http://localhost:8080>.

Models and files are written to `./library` on the host (bind-mounted); job
spool state and other app data live in the `tdmm_data` named volume.

**First-run admin password**: if `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is left unset in
`.env`, the api container generates a random password on first boot and
prints it exactly once, at `WARNING` level, to its logs:

```sh
docker compose logs api | grep -i password
```

Copy it down immediately — it is not recoverable afterwards (short of
resetting the `db` volume). To pin a known password instead (e.g. for
scripting), set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before the first `up`.
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` only ever seeds the account on that first boot; change the
password afterwards from **Settings → General**, not by editing `.env`.

To tear the stack down (keeping data): `docker compose down`. To also drop
the database/volumes: `docker compose down --volumes`.

**Worker split**: the processing pipeline's CPU-heavy steps (metadata
extraction, GLB conversion via OCCT/trimesh/lib3mf, `gltfpack` optimization,
`f3d` thumbnail rendering) run on `worker-cpu`, routed there by queue name;
everything else (`store_to_backend`, the upload path) runs on `worker-io`.
`worker-cpu` runs one process per core with no fixed concurrency, and
recycles each child process after 16 tasks or 1.5 GiB RSS, whichever comes
first, to contain memory growth from OCCT (STEP/IGES) and f3d. Both workers
expose a `celery inspect ping` healthcheck.

**Running as a non-root user (PUID/PGID)**: by default the api/worker
containers run as root, so files written under the bind-mounted `./library`
end up root-owned on the host. Set `PUID`/`PGID` in `.env` (e.g. to your
`id -u`/`id -g`) to have the entrypoint drop privileges to that uid/gid
instead (linuxserver.io convention) — it also `chown`s the existing
`./library`/`tdmm_data` contents to match on every start, so this is safe to
turn on after the fact. Verify the drop works without standing up the whole
stack:

```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t tdmm:local .
docker run --rm -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -e ROLE=api tdmm:local id -u
# -> 1000
```

## Upgrading

**Routine upgrade** (published image). Point `IMAGE_TAG` at the new release,
pull, and bring the stack back up:

```sh
IMAGE_TAG=v0.2.0 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml pull
IMAGE_TAG=v0.2.0 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml up -d
curl -s localhost:8080/api/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.2.0"}
```

That `/api/health` check is the whole verification step — it reports the
version baked into the image that is actually running, not the one you meant
to deploy. If it still shows the old version, the containers didn't get
recreated.

**There is no separate migration step.** The `api` container runs Alembic
migrations on startup, so bringing it up on a new image is what applies them.
But **migrations are one-way** — there is no downgrade path, and rolling
`IMAGE_TAG` back to the previous release does *not* roll the schema back. An
older image against a newer schema is not a supported configuration.

So: **take a database backup before upgrading.** See "Backup & Restore"
below for the `pg_dump` command and, just as importantly, the
`printer.key` that has to travel with it.

From a source checkout, the equivalent is:

```sh
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

If you're upgrading a deployment from before the Settings-UI move (Round
10): the five old env vars (`PRINTER_ENABLED`, `SCAN_INTERVAL`,
`COLLECTION_SYNC_INTERVAL`, `WATCH_INTERVAL`, `WATCH_STABLE`) and
`COMPOSE_PROFILES`/`--profile` are all obsolete. On the first boot after
upgrading, whichever of the five env vars are still set in `.env` seed the
new database-backed settings exactly once (a startup warning in the api
logs names any it saw); every boot after that ignores them completely, and
all further changes happen live from the Settings UI. Once you've
confirmed the values under **Settings → General → Automation & scheduling**
and **Settings → Printer** look right, delete those lines from `.env` —
they no longer do anything.

## Releases & versioning

Releases are automated by
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), driven by
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The commit
message prefix on `main` decides the next version:

- `feat:` → **minor** bump
- `fix:` → **patch** bump
- a breaking change (`feat!:`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) → also a
  **minor** bump while the project is pre-1.0, not a jump to `1.0.0`
  (`bump-minor-pre-major` in `release-please-config.json`) — a "Pre-alpha"
  project reaching 1.0 by accident helps nobody

Other prefixes (`chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`) don't trigger a
release on their own.

release-please keeps a **release PR permanently open** against `main`, and
rewrites it on every push: its diff is the pending `CHANGELOG.md` entry and
the version bumps. Nothing is published while it sits there. **Merging that
PR is the act of cutting a release** — it creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag, commits
the changelog, publishes the image ladder below, and opens a GitHub Release
with the extension attached. `CHANGELOG.md` is generated by that process; it
is never hand-edited.

### Published image tags

All on `ghcr.io/metril/3d-model-manager`:

| Tag | Moves? | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `v0.1.0` | Never | **Production.** An exact release, byte-for-byte reproducible. |
| `0.1` | Yes — newest patch in that minor series | Automatic patch updates, no feature changes. |
| `0` | Yes — newest release in that major series | Pre-1.0 this carries **no compatibility promise**; it exists for ladder symmetry. Don't deploy it. |
| `latest` | Yes — newest stable release | Casual/first-time deployments. |
| `edge` | Yes — **every** push to `main` | Testing unreleased work. **Not supported**: it can contain schema changes whose migrations are not in any release. |
| `sha-<short>` | Never | Pinning one specific commit, e.g. bisecting a regression. |

Every image reports its own build, so you never have to infer it from the tag
you think you pulled — `GET /api/health` returns it, and it's also
`info.version` in `/api/openapi.json` (and so in the `/docs` header). The
value is one of:

- a release semver, e.g. `0.1.0`
- `edge-<short sha>` for a build from a `main` push
- `dev` for an unstamped local `docker build` with no `APP_VERSION` build-arg

### Browser extension

The extension is versioned **in lockstep with the app** — same number, always
— and each release publishes it as a sideload zip
(`tdmm-extension-<version>.zip`, with a `.sha256` sidecar) attached to the
GitHub Release. Install and verification steps are in
[extension/README.md](extension/README.md).

## Storage backends & the scanner

The active storage backend (local directory, SMB, or S3 — exactly one at a
time) is chosen and configured from **Settings → Storage** in the running
app, not via `.env`: each backend's connection details (SMB host/share/
credentials, S3 bucket/keys/endpoint) are validated, connection-tested
before they take effect, and stored in the database. Switching backends
offers a **local→X migration** job that copies existing content over before
the switch flips live.

**SMB**: address the NAS by IP or a real, resolvable DNS name — never a bare
mDNS/`.local`/NetBIOS name, which the container's resolver can't see. For a
LAN-only DNS name, add an `extra_hosts:` entry for it to the `api`/
`worker-io`/`worker-cpu` services in `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
    extra_hosts:
      - "nas.lan:192.168.1.50"
```

**Rescan/reconcile**: trigger a scan from Settings → Storage (or `POST
/api/scan`) to reconcile the database against whatever is actually on the
backend — useful after reorganizing files directly on a share/NAS outside
the app. A scan relinks moved folders by hash (without re-hashing files
that didn't move), adopts folders dropped straight onto the share as new
draft models for review, and flags files present in the database but
missing on disk for a human to resolve. It never deletes library content or
database rows. **Manual `Scan now` runs immediately.** To also run scans on
a schedule, set a positive interval under **Settings → General →
Automation & scheduling** — `beat` (always running) picks the change up
within ~15 s, and (arm-and-skip) the first automatic run lands one full
interval after you enable it, not immediately.

Followed remote collections/favourites can sync on the same kind of
schedule instead of only via the Settings **"Sync now"** button (also
immediate) — set the collection-sync interval in the same **Settings →
General → Automation & scheduling** panel; the same ~15 s apply latency and
one-interval arm delay apply.

## Printer integration (Bambu LAN, feature-flagged)

**Off by default.** Enable it live, no restart, with the toggle at
**Settings → Printer** — `printerd` (always running) picks the change up
on its next reconcile tick. With the toggle off (the default), the app is
fully usable: the printers API 503s and the Printer nav hides.

**Printer prerequisites**: an A1/A1 mini on firmware **≥ 01.05.00.00**. On
the printer's screen, enable **LAN-only Mode**, power-cycle it, then enable
**Developer Mode** in the same menu; the **access code** shows on the
LAN-only screen (toggle LAN-only off and back on if it displays zeros). A
healthy **microSD card is mandatory** — without one, uploads fail with an
"Insert SD card" error. Pin the firmware version that's known to work for
you, and re-verify connectivity after every firmware update using the
setup wizard's **Test connection** (an MQTT connect + `pushall` probe).

**Tradeoff**: Developer Mode requires LAN-only Mode, which disconnects the
printer from **Bambu Cloud and the Bambu Handy app**. Deliver firmware
updates via microSD instead, or temporarily re-enable cloud connectivity
when you need one.

**ToS / responsibility**: LAN Developer Mode is a user-enabled,
**Bambu-unsupported** escape hatch — enabling it is your decision and your
responsibility. This app never uses the Bambu Connect signed cloud path.

**Security**: the printer's access code is stored **Fernet-encrypted**
(`printers.access_code_enc`) using a key at `${DATA_DIR}/secrets/
printer.key` (mode `0600`, auto-generated and shared across api/worker/
printerd via the `tdmm_data` volume) or supplied explicitly via
`PRINTER_KEY`. It is decrypted only inside the worker/printerd
processes, and is never returned by the API or written to logs. **TLS
verification is off in v1**: the printer's MQTT/FTPS/camera ports present a
self-signed certificate from Bambu's private CA that no system trust store
accepts (and there's no hostname to check against), so — like every other
LAN client — this app disables verification rather than trusting nothing. A
**TOFU (trust-on-first-use) certificate pin remains deferred** — pinning
needs the real A1 mini's self-signed certificate in hand, so it pairs with
the deferred live-hardware acceptance below.

**Sending**: only sliced **`.gcode.3mf`** files (Bambu Studio's "Export
plate sliced file") can be sent to a printer — a bare `.gcode` is rejected.
A print won't start unless the printer is idle (state ∈ `IDLE`/`FINISH`/
`FAILED`); a printer that's busy, offline, or of unknown state is rejected
before anything is uploaded.

Register a printer from **Settings → Printer** (host, serial, access code)
— the setup wizard runs **Test connection** against it before saving.

### Manual/Live Acceptance (deferred — user present, real A1 mini, NOT automated)

The physical "the A1 mini actually starts printing" drill needs a real
printer on the LAN and a person watching the first print start, so it is
**not** part of the automated test suite (see `backend/tests_e2e/
test_m4_printer.py` for the hardware-free flag-off/wizard/preflight
coverage that *is* automated). When hardware is available, run this once
against a real A1 mini:

1. On the printer: firmware ≥ 01.05, enable **LAN-only Mode** → power-cycle
   → enable **Developer Mode**; note the access code.
2. Flip the toggle on at **Settings → Printer**, then add the printer
   there (host/serial/access code); **Test connection** should report
   `ok:true` with a real `gcode_state`.
3. Export a plate as `.gcode.3mf` from Bambu Studio, upload it to a model,
   open **Files → Print**, pick the plate/AMS/calibration options, and
   **Send** — **the A1 mini starts the print** (the load-bearing
   acceptance for this milestone).
4. On `/printer`: confirm live **%/layer/remaining/temps** update; that
   **Pause/Resume/Stop** work; that **sending while RUNNING is blocked**;
   and that pulling the **microSD card** surfaces an actionable SD-missing
   error.

Record the outcome in the milestone ledger; file any firmware-drift
findings against the pinned-firmware note above.

## Bambu Studio integration

**No plugin hook exists.** Bambu Studio has no plugin SDK, and its
`bambustudio://` deep links are domain-allowlisted to `makerworld.com`
inside the binary — a self-hosted app has no way to register itself as a
target for Studio's own "send"/"open in" actions. The two loops below,
built on features Studio already exposes, are the supported path instead.

**1. Auto-upload every slice (metadata).** In Studio: **Process → Others →
Post-processing scripts**, add `python3 /path/to/bambu_postprocess.py`.
Studio runs it after every slice and appends the sliced file's path as the
last argument; the script itself (`scripts/bambu_postprocess.py` in this
repo, also downloadable from **Settings → Accounts → Slicer
integration**) reads two environment variables from wherever Studio
itself runs (set them in your shell profile, or wrap the command in a
small launcher — Studio doesn't let you pass any extra arguments of your
own):

- `INTAKE_URL` — e.g. `http://<this host>:8080/api/slicer/intake`
- `INTAKE_TOKEN` — an API token minted from **Settings → Accounts →
  Slicer integration**

Every sliced plate is uploaded and matched to an existing model by name,
or a new model is created if none matches. **This path only produces a
plain `.gcode`** — useful for print history/metadata, but not something
the app can send to a printer.

**2. Printable file (watched folder).** For a file you can actually print
from the app, use Studio's **File → Export → Export plate sliced file**
(`.gcode.3mf`) into a folder this instance watches. It's imported the same
way (matched/created by name), and because it's a real sliced plate, the
resulting file gets the **Send-to-printer** button (Files tab and Print
Queue). This is opt-in and OFF by default; enable it with:

- The poll interval and mtime-stability window, both under **Settings →
  General → Automation & scheduling** — a positive poll interval turns
  watching on (`0` means off); the stability window (default `10` s) is
  how long a file's mtime must be quiet before it's imported, guarding
  against importing an export that's still being written. `beat` (always
  running) picks up an edit within ~15 s.
- `WATCH_HOST_DIR` — the host directory to point Studio's
  export at, bind-mounted to `/watch` inside `worker-io` by
  `compose.yaml` (env-configured; there's no UI for this one since it's
  container topology, not a runtime feature)

A dropped file with an unrecognized extension is moved into `.failed/`
inside the watched folder; successfully imported files move into
`.imported/`.

Both loops authenticate with the **same bearer-token plane the browser
extension uses** — mint or revoke tokens from **Settings → Accounts →
Slicer integration** (or **Browser extension**; either card manages the
same token list, so a token from one works for the other).

## Gallery importers

**What it does.** Paste a **Thingiverse** or **Printables** model URL on
`/import`; the app detects the site, downloads every file into a new
library model with full attribution (source link, author, license, tags),
and runs it through the normal ingest pipeline (lands as
`rev-001_imported`). Imports are **atomic** — a failed or paid/Club model
creates no model.

**Thingiverse token setup.** Thingiverse requires a personal **App Token**
to download files: go to `thingiverse.com/apps/create`, register a
**"Desktop app"**, copy the **App Token**, and paste it in **Settings →
Gallery site tokens**. The token is stored masked and never shown again
(blank the field to keep the stored one). Printables needs **no token**
(free models only; **Club/paid models are rejected with a clear
message** — they require a Printables login).

**MakerWorld — not yet.** MakerWorld import is **deferred to a later
milestone** (it needs a Bambu-account login). Pasting a MakerWorld URL
shows a friendly "not available yet" message rather than failing.

**ToS / personal use.** These importers are for **personal use, one model
per action**; by importing you confirm the model's license permits it. The
`/import` page header carries this note. Respect each site's Terms of
Service and the model's license (imported CC attribution is preserved on
the model page).

**Reliability.** The Thingiverse API is historically flaky and the
Printables GraphQL schema is unofficial; both are isolated behind one
module each with recorded-fixture contract tests, and a failed import
never corrupts library state. A `live_importer`-marked smoke test per site
(deferred/manual, excluded from the default gate — see below) hits the
real API on demand.

## Backup & Restore

Three things hold state; back up all three together and they must stay in
sync on restore.

**1. The Postgres database.** Holds models/revisions/files, jobs, settings
(the storage-backend config with its **encrypted** SMB/S3 secret and the
**encrypted** Thingiverse token), and printers (`access_code_enc`). No host
port is published for `db`, so dump through the container:

```sh
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U tdmm tdmm > backup.sql
```

**2. `${DATA_DIR}/secrets/printer.key`** (or the matching
`PRINTER_KEY` value). **This is the critical one.** As of M6 this single
Fernet key decrypts the printer access codes **and** the SMB/S3 storage
secret **and** the Thingiverse token. **Lose it — or restore a database
against a *different* key — and every encrypted secret becomes permanently
undecryptable** (`InvalidToken`); everything else restores fine, but you'll
be re-entering every credential by hand. The DB dump and this key are a
matched pair: back them up together, restore them together. (Same key
described under [Printer integration → Security](#printer-integration-bambu-lan-feature-flagged).)

**3. The `library/` contents.** For the **local** backend this is the
`./library` bind-mount on the host — copy it like any directory. For the
**SMB** or **S3** backends the library lives on your own share/bucket, which
this app does not manage — back it up with your NAS/S3 tooling. Derivatives
are never stored here (see below).

**Do _not_ bother backing up:**
- `${DATA_DIR}/derivatives/**` — thumbnails and GLBs, all **regenerable**
  by re-running the pipeline against the library originals (the migrate task
  documents "derivatives always stay local"). Skipping them keeps backups
  small.
- `${DATA_DIR}/spool/**` — transient in-flight upload bytes, meaningless
  after the fact.

**Restore runbook:**

1. Bring up a fresh `db` service and load the dump:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d db
   docker compose exec -T db psql -U tdmm tdmm < backup.sql
   ```
2. Put `printer.key` back into the `tdmm_data` volume at
   `${DATA_DIR}/secrets/printer.key` (mode `0600`), **or** set the same
   `PRINTER_KEY` in `.env` — **before** starting api/worker/printerd, so
   the encrypted secrets decrypt and the eager startup re-encryption pass
   (idempotent, safe on already-encrypted data) doesn't run against the wrong
   key.
3. Restore `library/` (local backend) or confirm the SMB share / S3 bucket is
   reachable.
4. `docker compose up -d` — Alembic migrations run automatically on api boot.

The env vars that must match the backed-up stack: `DATABASE_URL`,
`DATA_DIR`, and the `db` service's `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
/ `POSTGRES_DB`.

> **Warning:** `docker compose down --volumes` destroys **both** the `pgdata`
> and `tdmm_data` volumes — that is your database, your derivatives, your
> **secrets** (`printer.key`), and the spool, gone together and
> irrecoverably. Like the first-run admin password, none of it comes back
> without a backup. Use plain `docker compose down` (no `--volumes`) to stop
> the stack while keeping state.

**Acceptance (deferred — one-time manual restore drill, not automated):**
like the printer's [live acceptance](#manuallive-acceptance-deferred--user-present-real-a1-mini-not-automated),
a full restore is verified by hand, not in the test suite: `pg_dump` a seeded
stack, `docker compose down --volumes`, then restore the DB + `printer.key` +
`library/` into a fresh stack and confirm the gallery renders, a printer's
access code still decrypts (Test connection succeeds), and a stored SMB/S3
secret still works — proving the key travelled with the DB.

## Development

### Backend

```sh
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

Requires a Postgres and Redis reachable at the `DATABASE_URL` /
`REDIS_URL` defaults (`localhost:5432` / `localhost:6379`) — the
easiest way is `docker compose up -d db redis`. Run the Celery worker
alongside the api for upload/ingest and pipeline processing:

```sh
uv run celery -A app.tasks.celery_app worker -Q io,cpu --concurrency=2 -l info
```

**M2 pipeline prerequisites**: run `scripts/fetch-gltfpack.sh` once (fetches
the `gltfpack` CLI, used by the `optimize_glb` step, into `backend/.tools/`
via npm — outside the uv-managed Python dependencies). `f3d` thumbnail
rendering needs no extra install for local dev: it falls back to Mesa's EGL
offscreen renderer automatically when OSMesa isn't available. `libosmesa6`
is only installed inside the Docker image, for that GPU-less container's
OSMesa path.

Tests (real Postgres + Redis via `testcontainers`, no mocks):

```sh
uv run pytest        # unit/integration suite (e2e + live_importer excluded via the -m in addopts)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

The full Docker-based end-to-end flow (build image, run compose stack, drive
the M1 upload/revision/diff/download/restart flow, the M2 metadata/GLB/
thumbnail pipeline flow, the M3 scan drill — move a folder on the
bind-mounted share, rescan, relink by hash, download-verify; drop an
untracked folder, rescan, adopt it as a draft model — and the M4 printer
flow — flag off (printers 503, app otherwise fine), flip the printer
toggle on, register a printer, probe it (soft-fails, no hardware), and
