"""Zip/3MF intelligence at import time (feat/import-fidelity T1 -- "Live
facts" in the task brief): MakerWorld's per-print-profile downloads arrive as
``<profile name>-<id>.zip`` but are actually mislabeled 3MF containers --
``layout.infer_blob_kind_format`` types purely by extension, so a bare
``.zip`` lands on ``BlobFormat.OTHER`` (``PIPELINE_STEPS[OTHER] = ()``,
nothing viewable) even though the bytes are a perfectly normal 3MF the
existing pipeline already knows how to mine whole. Thingiverse, by contrast,
ships a genuine ``ZipFile.zip`` of loose, arbitrary files -- that one needs
real extraction, member by member, so each ends up individually pipeline-
eligible instead of trapped inside an opaque OTHER-format archive.

``process_staged_zips`` is a PURE function over a staged-file list plus the
``Settings`` handle needed to spool new members -- no import-row coupling --
so a later re-download task (T3) can call the exact same zip intelligence
over its own staged list unchanged. Called from ``app.tasks.importing``
after the download loop and before ``create_imported_model_sync``.

Safety is the load-bearing property throughout: a weird/hostile/corrupt
archive must never fail an otherwise-successful import (Global Constraints
"IMPORTS ATOMIC" spirit) -- it just stays a single opaque zip file, exactly
as if this module didn't exist.
