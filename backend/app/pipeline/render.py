"""f3d-based headless mesh thumbnail rendering (SPEC pipeline rows 5-6;
RESEARCH §4's verified engine/options/render_to_image snippet).

Renders the raw, uncompressed ``glb`` DERIVATIVE ROW only -- never
``glb_web``/``glb_preview`` (Global Constraints "Two GLB artifacts per
blob": those are meshopt-compressed via gltfpack ``-cc``, and f3d -- like
trimesh/OCCT -- cannot read `EXT_meshopt_compression`/`KHR_mesh_quantization`
back). ``app.tasks.pipeline``'s ``render_thumb`` step and
``render_assembly_thumb`` task are the two callers.

Engine creation (Global Constraints "Local prerequisites"): ``create_osmesa()``
is the container path (Task 10's Docker image installs ``libosmesa6`` plus the
unversioned ``libOSMesa.so`` symlink f3d actually dlopens); ``create(True)``
(EGL offscreen) is this project's verified dev-host fallback -- neither a
GPU/X server nor libosmesa6 is available locally, but Mesa's EGL offscreen
platform renders fine. Mesa prints ``libEGL warning:`` lines to stderr while
probing render nodes it can't open -- expected noise, not a bug (pytest
captures it per-test).

That fallback is *guarded*, because on a host with NEITHER backend the two
calls fail very differently: ``create_osmesa()`` raises cleanly ("Cannot find
OSMesa library"), but ``create(True)`` SIGSEGVs inside Mesa when there is no
GPU render node and no swrast driver -- verified on a bare ubuntu:24.04
container and on a GitHub Actions runner, where it took down a whole pytest
process (exit 139) mid-suite. A segfault can't be caught in-process, so the
EGL call is rehearsed in a throwaway child process (``_egl_probe_failure``)
and only repeated here if that child survived; otherwise this raises a
``RuntimeError`` naming the OSMesa fix. Cost on the supported path is exactly
zero -- the container has OSMesa, ``create_osmesa()`` succeeds, and the probe
never spawns.

The engine is built once and cached per worker process: creating a fresh one
per render would be wasteful, and the worker's memory-recycled ``cpu`` pool
(SPEC "Architecture") bounds whatever state accumulates in one across many
renders.
