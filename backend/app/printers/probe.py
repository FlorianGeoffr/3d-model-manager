"""The staged Developer-Mode probe (Round 8 T1/T2 hardening): TCP
reachability -> TLS cert serial cross-match -> raw MQTT auth + status
report, each stage returning early with a SPECIFIC, actionable
``ProbeResult.detail`` instead of a bare exception string bubbling out of
the old lib-backed ``test_connection`` (a black-box "connected but no state"
covered "wrong access code", "wrong serial", "LAN mode off", and "not a
Bambu printer at all" all under one unhelpful message).

Stages are small, individually-stubbable helpers (``_tcp_check``/
``_cert_check``/``_mqtt_probe``) driven by ``staged_probe`` -- tests stub the
earlier stages to drive a single stage in isolation (table-driven in
``tests/test_bambu_probe.py``).

Import-safety: ``app.printers.discovery`` (stdlib + the eager
``cryptography`` dep) is safe to import at module level; ``paho.mqtt.client``
is lazy-imported INSIDE ``_mqtt_probe`` only, so this module stays
importable with the printer feature OFF (see
``tests/test_flag_off_imports.py``).
