"""DB-backed runtime feature settings (Round 10 "Settings" UI). Five knobs
that used to be env/`.env`-only -- `printer_enabled`, `scan_interval_s`,
`collection_sync_interval_s`, `watch_interval_s`, `watch_stable_s` -- move to
a single row in the `settings` table under key `"app"`, editable via
`GET`/`PUT /settings/app` (`app.api.settings`) without a container restart.
No crypto here: none of these five fields is a secret. Mirrors the async/
sync twin + fresh-dict upsert conventions already established by
`app.services.storage_config`/`app.services.import_tokens`, minus the
Fernet layer.

Resolution is PER-FIELD (`_resolve`): each of the five keys falls back
independently to its `Settings` env/default value when that key is absent
from the row's JSONB (or the row itself is absent), rather than requiring a
fully-populated row. This keeps the whole pre-existing test suite -- which
sets e.g. `PRINTER_ENABLED`/`SCAN_INTERVAL` via env/monkeypatch with no DB
row involved at all -- green untouched, and lets a row seeded before a
future sixth field is added degrade to that field's env/default instead of
a validation error.

`seed_app_config` runs once from the app lifespan (`app.main`) AFTER
`ensure_admin_user`: row absent -> insert the five env values (so a fresh
install's DB reflects its `.env` immediately, before any UI edit); row
present -> never overwrite (an operator's saved edit always wins, including
across a restart against a stale `.env`). `warn_ignored_env` then logs,
once per startup, that each deprecated env var still explicitly SET in the
environment is now ignored -- it only ever seeded the DB once; further
changes go through `PUT /settings/app` (the Settings UI) instead.
