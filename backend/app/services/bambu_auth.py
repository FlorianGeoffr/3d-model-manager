"""Bambu Lab account auth (Workstream B task B2; SPEC/full-design-doc line
230 "Connect Bambu account" flow). MakerWorld's model-FILE downloads are
gated behind a Bambu Lab cloud account -- this module owns login/MFA/refresh
against ``api.bambulab.com`` (global) / ``api.bambulab.cn`` (China), and the
at-rest storage of the resulting credential, mirroring
``app.services.import_tokens``'s posture exactly:

**Storage (SECURITY):** ``account`` + ``region`` + the ``refresh_token`` + (as
of the access-token fix below) the login/refresh-issued ``access_token`` and
its ``access_expires_at`` (a non-secret float epoch ESTIMATE; see
``_estimate_expiry``) are persisted in the ``settings`` table under key
``"bambu_auth"``. BOTH the refresh token and the access token are
Fernet-encrypted (``app.crypto``, the same seam as the M4 printer access code
/ M6 storage secrets / the Thingiverse import token), each with its own
``InvalidToken`` legacy-plaintext fallback on read (mirrors
``import_tokens.py`` even though this key is new -- cheap insurance against a
key file ever being swapped out from under an existing row). The PASSWORD is
used only transiently inside ``login()`` to make the one login HTTP call and
is never stored, logged, or returned. Bambu's login access token is actually
a LONG-LIVED JWT (not the short-lived token this module originally assumed),
so ``get_access_token_sync`` now PREFERS the stored, still-valid access token
over any network call, only reaching ``refresh()`` once that stored token is
within the early-refresh safety margin of its estimated expiry -- and, if
that refresh call itself fails, falling back to the stored access token
again if it's still (barely) unexpired. An in-memory, per-process cache
(``_ACCESS_TOKEN_CACHE``) keyed by the refresh token currently on file still
exists, now purely to avoid re-decrypting/re-estimating on every call within
one process rather than to avoid a network round trip (see the "Contract
confidence" refresh note below for why refresh is now best-effort). Neither
the access nor refresh token is ever logged.

**Contract confidence (BE HONEST about this at acceptance):**
- Login (``POST /user-service/user/login``) and its bad-credentials shape
  (HTTP 400 ``{"code":1,"error":"Incorrect account or password."}``) were
  LIVE-VERIFIED (grounding probe). The SUCCESS shape (direct
  ``accessToken``/``refreshToken``) and the MFA-challenge shape (some
  ``loginType``/continuation-token payload signaling an emailed verification
  code is needed, per SPEC full-design line 230's ``loginType:"verifyCode"``)
  are DOCUMENTED, NOT LIVE-CAPTURED -- no real Bambu account was available to
  grounding. ``_parse_login_response`` therefore parses tolerantly (several
  candidate field names) rather than asserting one exact shape, and treats
  "no recognizable token pair in an HTTP-200 body" as "MFA required",
  carrying the ENTIRE response body through as the opaque continuation
  context for ``verify_code`` rather than guessing which subset of fields
  matters. **This must be verified against one real login before being
  trusted in production** -- if the real shape differs, only
  ``_parse_login_response`` should need adjusting.
- Refresh (``POST /user-service/user/refreshtoken``) was LIVE-VERIFIED to
  EXIST and to 401 a fake token (grounding probe); its SUCCESS response shape
  is likewise documented-not-captured, so ``refresh()`` parses tolerantly
  too. The full design doc separately notes Bambu's refresh endpoint has
  historically been unreliable ("refresh endpoint is broken -> re-login UX
  with expiry banner") -- and that was subsequently LIVE-VERIFIED the hard
  way (2026-07-12): a real user's login (``POST /user-service/user/login``)
  succeeded four times in one evening, and every single time the very next
  worker call to ``refreshtoken`` -- against that SAME fresh, never-yet-used
  refresh token, seconds later -- 401'd, re-stamping ``refresh_failed_at``
  and producing a "sign in again" loop. Refresh is therefore now treated as
  BEST-EFFORT, not depended on: ``get_access_token_sync`` reaches ``refresh()``
  only once the stored access token nears its estimated expiry (see Storage
  above), and a refresh failure surfaces as a ``kind="expired"``
  ``BambuAuthError`` (prompting reconnection) ONLY when no usable access
  token remains at all -- a merely-failed refresh with a still-good access
  token on file is not treated as a reconnect-worthy failure. When a
  reconnect-worthy failure does happen, it persists a non-secret
  ``refresh_failed_at`` marker on the stored row (``mark_refresh_failed``/
  ``_sync``, cleared by ``clear_refresh_failed``/``_sync`` or any fresh
  ``set_bambu_auth``/``_sync`` write) so ``GET /settings/bambu`` can report
  ``needs_reconnect`` -- gated, in turn, by ``BambuAuthState.has_valid_
  access_token`` so a stale marker next to a still-valid access token doesn't
  falsely tell the operator to reconnect.

# `account`/`region`/the encrypted `refresh_token` -- never a new row, never
# logged, never containing a token value itself. `mark_*` is only ever
# called right after a `refresh()` call that raised `kind="expired"`
# (see `get_access_token_sync`); `clear_*` handles the one case a fresh
# `set_bambu_auth(_sync)` write doesn't already cover for free (a refresh
# that succeeds WITHOUT rotating the refresh token, so no such write
# happens) -- see `get_access_token_sync` below. Both are no-ops when
# nothing is connected (nothing to stamp/clear) so a caller never needs to
# guard the call itself.
#
# `mark_*` additionally take the REJECTED refresh token and only stamp when
# the row's CURRENT refresh token still equals it (compare-and-set, post-
# review fix M1). Two workers can race to refresh the same expiring token:
# if worker A wins and rotates in a new, valid refresh token first (which
# also clears any marker -- see `set_bambu_auth`/`_sync` above), worker B's
# now-stale rejection must not stamp a failure onto that already-healthy
# row. `populate_existing=True` forces a fresh read past this session's own
# identity map (both sessionmakers use `expire_on_commit=False`, so a row
# fetched earlier in the SAME session -- e.g. by `get_bambu_auth_sync` at
# the top of `get_access_token_sync` -- would otherwise still show the
# pre-race snapshot even after another session committed the rotation).
# Comparison is plain equality on the DECRYPTED value -- Fernet ciphertext
# isn't stable across encryptions of the same plaintext, and neither side of
# the comparison is ever logged or printed.

    """A currently-valid Bambu access token for worker use (MakerWorld's
    authenticated download/search calls, ``app.importers.makerworld``).

    Order of preference (see module docstring's Storage section for why):
    1. The in-memory, per-process cache (``_ACCESS_TOKEN_CACHE``, keyed by
       the refresh token on file) -- unchanged, avoids re-decrypting the row
       on every call within one process.
    2. The STORED access token (Fernet-encrypted at rest, decrypted by
       ``get_bambu_auth_sync``), if it's still valid past the early-refresh
       safety margin -- NO network call. This is the headline fix: Bambu's
       login-issued access token is a long-lived JWT, so most calls never
       need to touch ``refresh()`` (Bambu's refresh endpoint, historically
       unreliable and live-verified 2026-07-12 to reject even fresh, never-
       yet-used refresh tokens) at all.
    3. ``refresh()``, once the stored access token is within the margin of
       its estimated expiry (or absent). A successful refresh always
       persists the new access token + expiry (``set_bambu_auth_sync``,
       whether or not the refresh token itself rotated) -- the whole-row
       write also clears any stale ``refresh_failed_at`` marker for free.
    4. If ``refresh()`` itself fails with ``kind="expired"``: the stored
       access token ONE more time, this time with NO margin (plain
       not-yet-expired) -- a refresh attempt fires early (inside the
       margin), so its failure alone shouldn't strand a caller holding a
       token that's still technically good. Only when no usable access
       token remains at all does this persist ``refresh_failed_at``
       (``mark_refresh_failed_sync``, expiry-banner UX,
       ``GET /settings/bambu``'s ``needs_reconnect``) and re-raise.

    Raises a ``kind="not_configured"`` ``BambuAuthError`` when NEITHER a
    refresh token nor a valid stored access token exists (nothing connected,
    or a connection whose access token has expired with no refresh token to
    fall back on).
