"""SSE event publishing (Global Constraints: Redis pub/sub channel
``tdmm:events``, JSON event shape ``{"type": "job.updated", "job_id": ...,
"job_type": ..., "state": ..., "subject_type": ..., "subject_id": ...}``).

Two publish functions mirror the API(async)/worker(sync) split documented in
``app.tasks.base``: ``publish_job_event`` for async API-side code (used
directly by tests exercising the SSE endpoint; the jobs API itself doesn't
currently need to publish), ``publish_job_event_sync`` for Celery task
bodies (``app.services.jobs``'s ``mark_running``/``mark_done``/
``mark_failed``, called from ``app.tasks.ingest``). Each publish opens a
short-lived Redis connection rather than holding one open -- job events are
infrequent, so the extra connect cost is not worth the added lifecycle
complexity of a shared client, especially in Celery's prefork worker model.
