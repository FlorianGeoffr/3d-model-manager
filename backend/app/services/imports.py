"""Starting an import (M8 H extraction).

``POST /imports`` and "approve a queued review item" must behave identically:
detect the site, canonicalize, refuse to duplicate a model already in the
library (``app.services.import_dedup``), otherwise create the ``Import`` row and
dispatch the pipeline. Sharing one function keeps the dedup guard from drifting
between the two call sites.
