    copy in each named group EXCEPT the client's chosen keeper.

    Recomputes ``duplicate_files_report`` server-side rather than trusting
    the client's rows -- the report can have moved since the client fetched
    it (another delete, another upload). Every choice is validated against
    that fresh report BEFORE anything is deleted, so an invalid request
    (unknown group, or a keeper that isn't actually in its group) 404s with
    nothing touched -- same validate-then-mutate posture as
    ``bulk_hard_delete_models``. Groups NOT named in ``keep`` are left
    alone; the request is explicitly scoped to what it lists.

    Per-copy deletes go through ``try_delete_duplicate_copy``, which commits
    per file -- so a mid-loop storage failure on one copy leaves every
    already-deleted copy deleted (intended: the caller sees a partial
    ``deleted``/``skipped`` split rather than losing progress to a rollback).

    The keeper is re-verified to still exist right before its group's
    non-keepers are deleted: a concurrent ``DELETE /files/{id}`` landing on
    the keeper between the snapshot and this group's turn would otherwise
    let the loop delete every remaining copy of the blob's content. A
    vanished keeper skips the whole group -- its deletable copies with
    reason ``keeper_missing``, its old-revision ones keeping their own
    ``not_current_revision`` (they were never deletable to begin with, and
    the UI counts the two differently).
