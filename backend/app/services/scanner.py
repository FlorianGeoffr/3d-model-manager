"""The library scanner/reconciler (SPEC "Rescan/reconcile (`scan_library`)";
Task 5 brief).

**CRITICAL invariant (Global Constraints "SCANNER NEVER DELETES LIBRARY
FILES"):** this module only ever *reads* the backend (``walk``/``read``/
``stat``), touches ``verified_at``/``mtime``, repoints/inserts DB rows, and
marks files ``missing``. It NEVER calls ``backend.delete``/``backend.move``
on library content and NEVER deletes a ``files``/``models``/``revisions``
row. A DB path absent on disk is reported ``missing`` for a human to resolve
in the UI -- this module leaves it alone.

Runs entirely in the worker's SYNC world (see ``app.tasks.base``) -- callers
pass a plain SQLAlchemy ``Session``, never the API's async engine.

Reconcile algorithm (SPEC decision table, implemented exactly, in TWO
PASSES over the walk -- see ``run_scan``'s docstring / Task 5 fix-wave
Finding 1 for why a single pass isn't safe):

1. Snapshot ``{storage_path: File}`` (size comes from the joined ``Blob``).
2. Pass 1: ``backend.walk("")`` the tree once, skipping ``.3dmm.json``
   sidecars (handled separately below -- they aren't ``files`` rows). Per
   on-disk entry:
   - **Known path, unchanged** (size matches, and on local/SMB mtime matches
     within tolerance; S3 compares size only): touch ``verified_at``, count
     toward ``report["verified"]``. No re-hash.
   - **Known path, changed**: re-hash. Same hash -> just refresh
     ``mtime``/``verified_at``. New hash -> upsert the ``Blob``, repoint
     ``file.blob_hash``, append to ``report["changed"]``, best-effort
     re-enqueue the pipeline.
   - **Unknown path**: deferred to pass 2 (not yet hashed).
   Every known-path entry visited this pass is added to a ``seen`` set.
3. The CONFIRMED-missing set is computed only now, after the full walk:
   every snapshot row whose ``storage_path`` was never in ``seen``.
4. Pass 2, over the entries deferred in step 2: re-hash (``files_hashed``
   still only counts the actually-unknown paths, not the whole tree). Known
   hash with a matching row IN THE CONFIRMED-missing set (same hash +
   matching ``rel_path`` tail) -> relink (repoint ``storage_path``), and
   remove that row from the confirmed-missing set so it can't be claimed
   twice. Known hash with no such candidate, or unknown hash -> adopt
   (attach to an existing model+revision if the key fits
   ``<slug>/<dir_name>/<rel...>``, else create a draft ``Model`` +
   ``rev-001`` flagged ``review_state="adopted"``).
5. Whatever remains in the confirmed-missing set after pass 2 ->
   ``missing``. Its row and the (absent) object are both left untouched.
6. Counters + the report JSONB are written onto the ``ScanRun`` row, which is
   marked ``state="done"``.

A single unreadable file (``report["errors"]``: TOCTOU deletion between
``walk`` and ``read``, or a transient SMB/S3 read error) is recorded and
skipped rather than aborting the whole run -- see ``_record_error``.

**Multi-backend (Workstream C task C2):** ``run_scan_all_backends`` -- the
entrypoint ``app.tasks.scan.scan_library`` actually calls -- loops every
configured ``storage_backends`` row and runs the algorithm above ONCE PER
BACKEND via ``_reconcile_against_backend``, scoped to the ``files`` rows
whose ``backend_id`` matches that backend (default backend also covers any
NULL ``backend_id``, the pre-migration-seed safety net). Each backend's
``missing_candidates`` set is therefore built from ONLY that backend's own
files, so a file that simply lives on a *different* backend is never
reported missing just because it wasn't on THIS backend's walk; adopted and
relinked files are stamped with the currently-walked backend's id and get a
``file_locations`` row. ``run_scan`` itself keeps its original single-backend
signature (``backend`` passed in directly, no DB backend lookup) for
backward compatibility with direct callers/tests that inject a backend
object of their own (e.g. the synthetic in-memory harnesses in
``tests/test_scanner.py``) -- called with no backend scoping (the historical
behavior), it reconciles every ``files`` row unfiltered, same as before this
task.

Implementation decisions not spelled out verbatim by the SPEC table (documented
here rather than guessed silently, per the task's "stop on genuine ambiguity"
instruction -- none of these affect data-integrity, only report/adoption
bookkeeping for corner cases the table doesn't enumerate):

- ``report["verified"]`` is only bumped by the cheap size/mtime match (SPEC
  text literally scopes it to the "unchanged" row); a re-hash that lands back
  on the SAME hash (the "changed" row's first branch) updates ``mtime``/
  ``verified_at`` but isn't separately counted anywhere.
- The "adopted duplicate" branch (known hash, no relink candidate) and the
  "unknown hash" adopt branch share one attach-or-create-draft helper: SPEC
  spells out the fits-existing-model/else-create-draft split only for the
  unknown-hash case, but the same fallback is the only sane behavior for a
  duplicate that also doesn't fit anywhere.
- If attaching an adopted file would collide with an existing
  ``(revision_id, rel_path)`` row (a pre-existing DB inconsistency), it falls
  through to the create-draft-model branch instead of raising -- a single
  odd file must never abort the whole scan.
- The scanner also refreshes stale ``.3dmm.json`` sidecars it encounters
  (Global Constraints carried item: sidecars could go stale before Task 5's
  ``patch_model`` fix started keeping them in sync going forward) -- read
  back, compared against the model's current authoritative content, and
  rewritten only if they differ.
