"""Resolve a Bambu Studio slicer upload (``POST /api/slicer/intake``, Round 8
Task 4) to a model + file, creating or attaching as needed.

Async/sync twins, house convention (mirrors ``app.services.library``'s
``create_model``/``create_imported_model_sync`` and
``finalize_upload``/``store_imported_file_sync`` pairs): ``resolve_and_attach``
runs in the API's async world, off the raw-body spool-tee ``app.api.slicer``
does exactly like ``app.api.uploads``; ``resolve_and_attach_sync`` is the T5
watcher's sync twin, given an already-staged ``StagedFile`` (mirrors
``app.tasks.importing``'s usage of ``store_imported_file_sync``). Both are
thin wrappers over the SAME pure naming logic
(``app.services.slicer_naming``) and reuse the existing finalize/store seams
rather than duplicating them.
