"""SPA static-file serving with client-side-routing fallback (Task 9:
Docker/compose integration).

Enabled only when ``STATIC_DIR`` is set (default ``None``, i.e.
disabled for local development, where the Vite dev server serves the
frontend and proxies ``/api`` to this backend instead -- see README
"Development"). When enabled, ``app.main.create_app`` calls ``mount_spa``,
which adds a single catch-all ``GET`` route, registered AFTER
``api_router`` so it never shadows an actual API route:

- ``GET /api/...`` for anything ``api_router`` didn't already match falls
  through to FastAPI's normal JSON 404 -- this route explicitly declines
  any path starting with ``api/`` rather than serving the SPA shell for it.
- A path that resolves to a real file under ``static_dir`` is served as-is
  (JS/CSS/images/etc, and the SPA's own ``index.html`` if requested by
  name or as ``/``).
- Anything else falls back to ``index.html`` so the client-side router
  (TanStack Router) gets a chance to render the matching page -- e.g.
  ``/models/some-slug`` has no file on disk but is a valid frontend route.
