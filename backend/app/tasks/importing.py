"""``import_from_url`` Celery task (SPEC "Gallery importers"; controller
decision 3). Site-agnostic orchestration over the SiteImporter contract,
in the worker's SYNC world (app.tasks.base):

  (a) FETCHING  -> fetch_metadata + list_files; reject paid/Club/exclusive
                   (metadata.reject_reason) BEFORE any download.
  (b) DOWNLOADING-> stream EVERY file to spool (blake3 each). ALL must succeed,
                   then ``app.importers.archives.process_staged_zips`` sniffs/
                   extracts every staged ``.zip`` (T1: mislabeled-3MF rename
                   in place, or real extraction with the archive discarded)
                   before anything is stored. T2's site cover + gallery
                   images (``_download_gallery_images``) are the ONE
                   exception to "ALL must succeed" -- each is independently
                   best-effort, never fails the import.
  (c) create model+revision (provenance) + per-file finalize/store dispatch
      (T1's files, then T2's gallery images, then ``cover_blob_hash`` set
      from whichever staged image was the cover); set imports.model_id; DONE.

Any failure in (a), (b), OR (c) ⇒ FAILED, model_id NULL, ZERO orphan
Model/Revision/File rows (Global Constraints "IMPORTS ATOMIC"): a failure
partway through (c) -- after Model+Revision are already committed -- deletes
the just-created model (the DB's ON DELETE CASCADE takes its Revision/File
rows with it) rather than leaving it orphaned. A rejected/failed import is a
NORMAL terminal state recorded on the row -- the task swallows the exception
(after marking FAILED) rather than re-raising, so ``POST /imports`` returns
the created row and the client polls its state (in eager test mode the task
runs inline, so this also keeps POST from 500ing on an expected rejection).

**M6 Task 4 (B1) -- re-entry idempotency under `task_acks_late` redelivery:**
a worker hard-killed (SIGKILL/OOM) mid-import never runs the `except` below;
Celery redelivers the same message and a naive reprocess-from-scratch would
create a SECOND model, and -- if the crash landed after phase (c)'s model
commit but before `DONE` -- orphan the first one behind a row stuck
`downloading` forever. Two mechanisms close this (mirrors `app.tasks.scan`'s
singleton lock):

1. A per-import Redis lock (``import_lock_key``) makes a genuinely
   concurrent redelivery (the original attempt still in-flight) a clean
   no-op -- the losing side returns immediately without touching the row.
2. `imp.model_id` is linked immediately after the model is created in
   phase (c) (rather than after the whole per-file store loop), AND in the
   SAME commit as the Model+Revision insert (``create_imported_model_sync``
   is called with ``commit=False`` for exactly this) -- so there is no
   window where a Model is durably committed while the link is not. A crash
   from that point on leaves a *detectable* orphan: the model exists, is
   linked from the import row, but the row's state never reached `DONE`. The
   task's entry guard reconciles against this on every run -- a terminal
   (`DONE`/`FAILED`) row is a no-op (nothing to redo), while a non-terminal
   row with `model_id` already set is exactly that partial-commit crash:
   delete the orphan model (cascade takes its Revision/File rows) and
   reprocess fresh. A crash BEFORE that single commit leaves nothing at all
   (the flushed-but-uncommitted Model/Revision are discarded when the
   session closes without committing). This still upholds the "ZERO
   orphans" invariant above: the same-execution failure handler's orphan
   delete relies on ``imports.model_id``'s ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` to null
   the link as part of that same statement, whether the early link had
   already committed or not."""
