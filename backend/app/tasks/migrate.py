"""``migrate_storage`` Celery task (Task 6 brief): copies the whole library
tree from the currently active backend onto a candidate TARGET backend,
verifying each file's blake3 hash as it streams across, and only cuts the
active ``storage`` setting over to the target once every file has verified.

Never deletes the source (Global Constraints: the migrated library is left
in place for the operator to remove by hand once they've confirmed the
cutover). Never touches derivatives (Global Constraints "DERIVATIVES ALWAYS
STAY LOCAL"): they live under ``{settings.data_dir}/derivatives/...`` on
local disk regardless of the active library backend, entirely outside the
``StorageBackend`` abstraction this task walks.

Runs entirely in the worker's SYNC world -- see ``app.tasks.base``.
