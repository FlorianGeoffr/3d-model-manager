"""Send-to-printer flow (SPEC "Printer integration"; RESEARCH §4). io queue.
Validate .gcode.3mf -> preflight state ∈ {IDLE,FINISH,FAILED} -> FTPS upload
-> project_file. Decrypts the access code HERE (worker) only; every failure
marks the print_jobs row FAILED with an actionable message.

Both CRITICAL invariants are re-checked HERE, authoritatively, regardless of
what the API's fast pre-checks already found (closing the TOCTOU between the
API request and this task actually running):

- bare-``.gcode``/no-plate-gcode reject: ``gcode3mf.assert_plate_available``
  opens the REAL archive bytes fetched from storage and requires the
  requested plate's ``Metadata/plate_N.gcode`` to be physically present --
  it never trusts the blob's ``format`` label.
- preflight gate: ``read_state_sync``/``preflight_ok`` are re-read at the
  moment of sending, not carried over from the API's own read.

In both cases the failure happens BEFORE ``build_adapter``/
``upload_and_start`` are ever reached, so a rejected job never touches the
printer.
