"""``relocate_model_storage`` Celery task (Workstream C multi-backend storage
design spec's "Relocate" section -- labeled task C2 in the shared spec, but
implemented here as task C3): moves or replicates every file of a model,
across ALL its revisions, from its current PRIMARY backend onto a TARGET
backend.

Reuses ``app.tasks.migrate``'s streaming copy-while-hashing-then-verify
pattern (a ``_chunks`` closure feeding ``dest.write`` while hashing, then
asserting ``result.hash`` against the expected hash) -- but per FILE rather
than per whole-tree walk, since a model's files can already span more than
one source backend (that's the whole point of Workstream C): each file
resolves its OWN current primary backend independently before copying.

**Content-dedup note:** physical storage here is layout-addressed, not
content-addressed -- the same blob referenced by two ``files`` rows at two
different ``storage_path`` keys exists as two independent physical objects
(see ``app.services.storage_backends`` module docstring). Relocating a file
therefore moves only THAT file's path; a sibling file elsewhere in the model
(or a different model entirely) that happens to share the same blob hash is
completely unaffected, even if it's never itself relocated.

**Verify-before-delete (move mode):** the target copy is streamed, hashed,
and verified -- and its ``file_locations`` row committed -- before anything
on the source is touched. Only once that's durably committed does this task
flip ``files.backend_id`` to the target and delete the source object/row.
This ordering (copy+verify+commit, THEN cut over, THEN delete source) means
a crash at any point before the delete leaves the source fully intact, so no
in-flight relocation can ever lose data -- the worst a crash can do is leave
extra bytes on the source backend that a later re-run of THIS SAME relocate
(current_backend_id already flipped to target) won't come back to clean up.
That stray-bytes case is a deliberately accepted, purely cosmetic trade-off:
it duplicates storage, but it never loses or orphans a DB reference.

Each file's copy + bookkeeping commits independently (its own
``base.sync_session()``), mirroring the scanner's per-chunk checkpoint
commits: a job that crashes partway through a large model leaves the
files already relocated exactly as they are (retryable no-ops, see below)
and picks back up on the remaining ones on retry.

Runs entirely in the worker's SYNC world -- see ``app.tasks.base``.
