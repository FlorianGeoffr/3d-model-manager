"""The ``scan_library`` Celery task (SPEC "Rescan/reconcile"; Task 5 brief).

A Redis singleton lock (``SCAN_LOCK_KEY``) keeps two scans from ever running
concurrently -- a losing task marks its own ``ScanRun`` ``skipped`` rather
than blocking, since the API's own ``POST /api/scan`` 409s ahead of time on
any ``queued``/``running`` row; the lock is the last-line defense against a
race (two nearly-simultaneous POSTs) or a manually-dispatched task.

**Task 5 fix-wave Finding 2 (stale ``running`` reclaim):** a worker that's
hard-killed (SIGKILL/OOM) mid-scan never reaches ``scan_library``'s
``except``/``finally`` -- its ``ScanRun`` is stuck ``state="running"``
forever, and both the API's 409 guard and this module's own beat in-flight
check would otherwise block every future scan permanently. Both call sites
treat a ``running`` row as reclaimable when ``SCAN_LOCK_KEY`` is NOT
currently held in Redis: since the lock itself carries a
``_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S`` expiry, "nobody holds it" reliably means "no worker is
actively running a scan right now", whether that's because the lock was
cleanly released or because a dead worker's lock has since expired. This
piggybacks on a TTL the lock already has for its own correctness rather than
inventing a second, independently-tracked staleness window on the row
itself (which could drift out of sync with the lock's real timeout).
