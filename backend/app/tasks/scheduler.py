"""Database-driven scheduler dispatcher (Round 10 Task 2 -- "Settings" UI).

Before this module, every scheduled feature (``app.tasks.scan
.schedule_scan_library``, ``app.tasks.sync_collections.schedule_sync_all``,
``app.tasks.slicer_watch.scan_slicer_watch``) had its OWN conditional
``beat_schedule`` entry in ``app.tasks.celery_app``, built ONCE from
``Settings`` at process import time. Flipping an interval via the new
``PUT /settings/app`` (``app.services.app_config``) therefore had no effect
until every celery process -- api, worker, AND beat -- was restarted, since
beat's schedule was baked in at import.

This module replaces those three conditional entries with a SINGLE
unconditional beat entry, ``dispatch_scheduled``, ticking every
``_CADENCE_S`` seconds (see ``app.tasks.celery_app``). Each tick re-reads
the DB-backed ``AppConfig`` (``get_app_config_sync``) fresh and decides, per
feature, whether that feature's own interval has actually elapsed since it
last fired -- an edit via the Settings UI takes effect on the very next
tick, no restart required.

**Per-feature bookkeeping lives in Redis, not the DB**: one string key per
feature (``tdmm:sched:last:{scan,sync,watch}``, see ``_due``) holds a Unix
timestamp of its last dispatch.

**Arm-and-skip**: the first tick that ever sees a feature (its stamp key
missing -- a fresh deploy, a Redis flush, or the feature just having been
turned on) ARMS the stamp to ``now`` and returns ``False`` rather than
firing immediately. This deliberately avoids a thundering herd of
scan+sync+watch all firing on the very first tick after every deploy; the
cost is that a feature's first real run lands one full interval after it's
enabled, not instantly. An interval of ``0`` (feature off) never touches
the stamp at all, so turning a feature on later arms cleanly from that
point rather than firing immediately off a stamp written while it was off.

**Dispatch lock** (``DISPATCH_LOCK_KEY``): a non-blocking Redis singleton
lock, mirroring ``app.tasks.scan``/``app.tasks.slicer_watch``'s own locks --
guards against two overlapping ticks (a slow previous tick, or beat
misconfigured to run more than one process) both evaluating/firing at once.
A losing tick just returns; every stamp it would have checked is left
untouched, so the next tick re-evaluates from the same baseline.

``watch`` mirrors the deleted conditional entry's gating exactly:
``settings.watch_dir`` stays env-only (a filesystem path, not a
runtime-editable setting) and the watch interval is only even consulted --
so its stamp only arms -- once a watch dir is actually configured.
