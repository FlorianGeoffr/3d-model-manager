"""``scan_slicer_watch`` Celery task (Round 8 Task 5: watched folder
auto-import). A companion entry point to ``POST /api/slicer/intake``
(Round 8 Task 4) for slicers -- Bambu Studio included -- that can't run a
post-processing script but CAN export finished sliced files straight into a
directory: point ``TDMM_SLICER_WATCH_DIR`` (``settings.slicer_watch_dir``) at
that folder and Celery beat polls it every ``TDMM_SLICER_WATCH_INTERVAL_S``
seconds, resolving each new file to a model exactly like the intake endpoint
does (``app.services.slicer_intake.resolve_and_attach_sync``).

**Redis singleton lock** (``SLICER_WATCH_LOCK_KEY``), mirroring
``app.tasks.scan``'s ``SCAN_LOCK_KEY``: a losing tick (the previous poll is
still running -- an unusually large drop, or a slow storage backend) just
returns immediately rather than racing a second pass over the same
directory. There is no tracking row to reclaim/mark on a lock loss (unlike
``ScanRun``/``Import``) -- an unprocessed file is simply picked up again on
the NEXT tick, so silently skipping this one is enough.

**Per-file isolation**: one bad file (unreadable, a DB hiccup, a storage
error) must never stall every other file sitting in the folder -- each
entry is staged/resolved/moved independently, and any exception is caught,
logged, and turned into a move to ``.failed/`` before moving on to the next
entry.

**Stability check**: a slicer can still be mid-write when a poll tick
lands (a large ``.gcode.3mf`` export takes real time to flush to disk). A
file whose mtime is younger than ``settings.slicer_watch_stable_s`` seconds
is left exactly where it is and reconsidered on a later tick -- imported
only once it's stopped changing.

**Terminal subdirectories**: ``.imported/`` and ``.failed/`` live INSIDE the
watched directory itself, so both the "skip dotfiles" rule and the
top-level-only ``iterdir()`` walk keep every future poll from ever touching
an entry that already landed in either one -- no separate bookkeeping (DB
row, sidecar file, ...) needed to remember what's already been handled.
