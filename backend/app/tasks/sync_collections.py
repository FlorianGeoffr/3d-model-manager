"""Periodic sync of the user's followed remote collections (M8 H).

Walks every ``followed_collections`` row, lists that remote list's items, and
for each item that is NOT already in the library
(``app.services.import_dedup``) either:

* ``mode="auto"``   -> creates an ``Import`` row and dispatches the normal
  ``import_from_url`` pipeline, or
* ``mode="review"`` -> parks it in ``pending_imports`` for one-click approval.

Re-walking a list is naturally idempotent: item identity is
``(site, external_id)``, the dedup guard answers "already imported?", and
``add_pending_sync`` is a no-op for an already-queued item. An item that has
since landed in the library is also un-queued, so a stale review row can't
linger forever.

One failing site/list is recorded on THAT row's ``last_error`` and never sinks
the rest of the run. Runs entirely in the worker's SYNC world -- see
``app.tasks.base``.
