"""Route-level auth sweep (SPEC requirement 1: "every /api route except
/api/auth/login and /api/health requires a valid session cookie").

``app/api/__init__.py`` enforces this with a single router-level
``require_session`` dependency on ``protected_router`` rather than a
per-endpoint check, specifically so no one has to remember to wire auth into
every new endpoint by hand. This test is the other half of that bargain: it
enumerates every operation from the app's own OpenAPI schema (rather than a
route list maintained by hand here, which would drift) and asserts each one
401s with no session cookie -- so a future route that lands outside
``protected_router`` by mistake fails a test immediately instead of shipping
as a silent auth hole.

``/ext/*`` (M10 Workstream A) is the one family of routes NOT gated by
``require_session`` -- it carries its own router-level ``require_api_token``
dependency instead (see ``app.api.ext``). A bare request with no session
cookie AND no bearer token still 401s there, for a different reason, so this
sweep still catches an ``/ext`` route that accidentally loses its auth
dependency; the bearer-specific contract (missing/malformed/revoked token,
and the reverse scope-isolation direction) is covered in
``test_ext_api.py``.
