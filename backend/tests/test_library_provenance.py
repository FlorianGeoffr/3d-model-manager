    """M6 Task 4 fix-review defect: the import worker must create the Model

    Constraints "IMPORTS ATOMIC") -- two separate commits leave a window
    where the Model is durably committed but the link (and the import's
    state) is not, which no redelivery guard can tell apart from a
    legitimate in-flight link. ``commit=False`` lets the caller
    (``app.tasks.importing``) defer the commit until it has also set
    ``imp.model_id`` in the SAME transaction. Proven here via cross-
    connection visibility on the real Postgres testcontainer: with
    ``commit=False`` the row must stay invisible to an independent
    connection until the ORIGINAL caller commits."""
