# Browser extension — Send to my library

A sideloaded Chrome (MV3) extension that saves MakerWorld, Thingiverse, and
Printables model pages straight into your self-hosted 3D Model Manager
library, and keeps the app's stored MakerWorld cookie fresh while you browse
— no more copying cookie values out of DevTools by hand.

## Install (sideload)

This extension isn't published to the Chrome Web Store — sideload it from the
zip attached to each GitHub release:

1. Download `tdmm-extension-<version>.zip` and its `.sha256` sidecar from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/metril/3d-model-manager/releases/latest).
2. Verify it, then unpack:

   ```sh
   sha256sum -c tdmm-extension-<version>.zip.sha256
   unzip tdmm-extension-<version>.zip -d tdmm-extension
   ```

3. Open `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder (the one containing
   `manifest.json`).

Chrome won't update a "Load unpacked" extension for you — to upgrade, download
the newer release's zip, unpack it over the same folder, and hit **Reload** on
the extension's card in `chrome://extensions`.

**Or, for development**: point **Load unpacked** at this `extension/` folder
directly from a source checkout. Same steps 3-5, no download — and your edits
are live on **Reload**.

### Versioning

The extension shares one version with the app, always. Release `v0.4.0` of
the app ships extension `0.4.0`; there is no independent extension version to
track.

Establishing that cost a **one-time renumber from `0.3.0` down to `0.1.0`**
when the extension moved onto the app's release train. That's a version going
*backwards*, which sounds alarming and isn't: Chrome's downgrade protection
applies to **packed CRX updates delivered through an update URL**, and this
extension is installed unpacked via **Load unpacked**, which performs no
version comparison at all. If you have an older sideload, replace the folder
and reload — nothing will object.

## Configure

1. Open the extension's options page (right-click its toolbar icon → **Options**,
   or `chrome://extensions` → the extension's **Details** → **Extension options**).
2. Enter your app's base URL, e.g. `http://your-host:8080` (no trailing path).
3. Mint an **API token** in the app itself, at **Settings → Imports → Browser
   extension**, and paste it in.
4. Click **Save** — Chrome prompts for permission to reach your app's
   origin; grant it (the extension only asks for the one origin you gave it,
   nothing broader).
5. Click **Test connection** to confirm the app is reachable and the token
   is valid.

## Usage

- **Toolbar button**: open a model page on MakerWorld, Thingiverse, or
  Printables, click the extension's toolbar icon, then **Save to my
  library**.
- **Right-click a link**: on any page, right-click a link to a model on one
  of those sites and choose **Save model to my library** from the context
  menu — no need to open the link first.

After **Save to my library**, the popup polls the app for whether the
import actually finished, and common failure causes surface right in the
popup (e.g. "Bambu sign-in expired — reconnect your Bambu account in
Settings.") instead of a generic "Added" that isn't actually true — the
poll only runs while the popup stays open, so if you close it right after
saving, check the app itself for the outcome.

## Syncing your MakerWorld collections

MakerWorld blocks servers from listing your named collections (the SSR route
behind them is intermittently Cloudflare-walled from a server IP), and it
also serves each *named* collection's own item list as empty from a server
IP even when the request itself succeeds (the app only ever gets your
"all collected models" aggregate back) — so the app can't enumerate either
your per-collection structure or a named collection's contents on its own.
Your browser, already signed in, can see both just fine. To hand that over,
just **visit your MakerWorld collections page**
(`makerworld.com/@<your handle>/collections`) while signed in — the
extension notices and syncs automatically, no click required.

The extension reads your collections page's *live* data — the same
`/_next/data/...` route the page itself uses to render — rather than trusting
whatever was embedded in the page on its first load, so it still works
correctly if you got to the collections page by clicking around inside
MakerWorld rather than loading it fresh. It syncs *all* of your collections,
including private ones, not just the ones you've made public, and it reads
each collection's own contents the same live way instead of relying on an
endpoint that can come back empty even when you're signed in and looking
right at the page.

That visit pushes your collection list (so a collection you follow by
pasting its URL shows its real title instead of a generic placeholder), then
reads and pushes each collection's contents. It's throttled to only push
when something's actually changed since the last sync, so revisiting the
same unchanged page repeatedly doesn't spam the app. This happens silently
in the background — if it fails (app unreachable, page unreadable, etc.),
nothing is shown in the tab; check the browser's extension console if
collections aren't showing up as expected. Turn it off on the options page
(**Sync collections automatically when you visit your MakerWorld collections
page**) if you'd rather trigger it by hand.

The popup's **Sync collections to app** button still works exactly as
before, as a manual trigger: click the extension's toolbar icon while on
your collections page, then **Sync collections to app**. The status line
tracks progress and finishes with something like "Synced 3 collections (24
items)." If a collection's items couldn't be read from the page, the count
is called out, e.g. "Synced 3 collections (18 items; 1 collection
unreadable)" rather than silently synced empty. Re-run any time your
collections (or their contents) change (or just revisit the page for the
automatic sync to pick it up) — each sync replaces what the app has cached
for a given list with what's on the page, so a deleted/renamed collection or
an added/removed item updates too.

## The MakerWorld courier

While you're signed in and browsing makerworld.com, the extension watches
for your MakerWorld session cookie and, when it changes, pushes the new
value to the app so your followed MakerWorld collections keep syncing
without you ever opening DevTools.

**Honest caveat**: this only happens while your browser is running and you
visit makerworld.com. If the cookie fully expires during a long stretch with
the browser closed (or without a MakerWorld visit), syncing pauses until you
next sign in and browse to makerworld.com — the extension has no way to
refresh a cookie it can't see.

## Running the tests

```sh
node --test extension/test/*.test.js
```

Use the glob form above, not a bare `extension/test` directory — the
directory form is broken on Node 24.
