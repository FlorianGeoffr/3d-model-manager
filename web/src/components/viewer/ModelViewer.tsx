/**
 * In-browser GLB viewer (Task 8). Loaded exclusively via
 * `React.lazy(() => import("@/components/viewer/ModelViewer"))` from
 * `ViewerTab` — this is the lazy-chunk boundary that keeps three.js/R3F/drei
 * out of the main bundle (Global Constraints "BUNDLE RULE"), so this module
 * (and anything it imports) must stay a `default export` and must not be
 * imported eagerly anywhere else.
 *
 * Deviation from SPEC "Frontend" viewer paragraph (controller-approved, see
 * `.superpowers/sdd/m2-constraints.md`): no drei `<Stage>` and no
 * `<Environment preset=…>`/`files=…` -- both fetch HDRs from a CDN at
 * runtime and this app must work fully offline/self-hosted. That constraint
 * does NOT rule out image-based lighting generally: `<Environment>` only
 * takes the network-fetching `EnvironmentCube` path `if (files || preset)`
 * (`@react-three/drei/core/Environment.js`); given `<Lightformer>` children
 * and neither prop, it renders those emissive planes into a local cube
 * render target instead -- real IBL, zero network. That's what the rig below
 * uses, plus real directional lights and ACES Filmic tone mapping (now
 * applied in the postprocessing composer, see `scene/Effects.tsx`), so PBR
 * materials (authored assuming IBL) get specular response and the model
 * reads as solid instead of flat and chalky.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE (B1 "toggle-fix core"): every combinable part stays mounted
 * for as long as it's in `parts`, whether or not its checklist checkbox is
 * checked -- toggling a checkbox only flips a `<group visible>` flag inside
 * `GltfPart`, it never adds/removes that part's subtree. Two library facts
 * forced this design:
 *
 *  1. `<Canvas>` wraps ALL of its children in exactly ONE internal
 *     `<Suspense>`. If a newly-checked part's `useGLTF` suspends, R3F hides
 *     the WHOLE already-committed scene until that one GLB resolves, then
 *     un-hides it -- which re-fires every layout effect underneath,
 *     including `Bounds`'s, and jumps the camera. Checking one more part
 *     must not blank parts that already loaded, so each part gets its OWN
 *     `<Suspense>` (`GltfPart`'s per-part wrapper below), not a shared one.
 *  2. drei's `Center`/`Resize` re-measure in a `useLayoutEffect` whose deps
 *     do NOT include their children -- toggling which parts render would
 *     never trigger a re-measure on its own. `BoundsRefitter` below is the
 *     explicit re-measure path, driven off `loadedCount` (how many parts
 *     have actually finished loading), not off visibility.
 *
 * Visibility toggles are therefore deliberately cheap: `THREE.Box3.
 * expandByObject` (which every `Box3.setFromObject` call -- `Center`,
 * `Resize`, `Bounds`'s default `refresh()` -- goes through) ignores
 * `.visible`, so hidden parts still count toward the combined bounding box
 * that grounds and normalizes the scene (`Center`/`Resize` stay stable
 * across toggles). Camera FRAMING is the exception: `BoundsRefitter` fits
 * the visible parts' world-space union (`getVisibleBox`), not the full
 * assembly -- otherwise 1 checked part of 11 renders tiny inside the whole
 * assembly's frame. Showing/hiding a part still never triggers a refit by
 * itself: `BoundsRefitter` only runs when `loadedCount` changes (a part
 * finishing its GLB load) or `fitSignal` bumps (an explicit Fit), never on
 * a plain checkbox click -- the new visible set is simply what the next fit
 * measures.

/** Re-measures and refits the camera as parts finish loading, or on demand
 * via `fitSignal` -- `Bounds` is mounted without `fit`/`clip`/`observe`
 * (see below), so it never fits on its own, and `Resize`/`Center` don't
 * watch their children either; nothing else would re-frame the camera as a
 * second/third part's GLB arrives. `fitSignal` is `ViewerStage`'s "Fit view"
 * button/`F` key and the ortho toggle's post-swap recovery (see
 * `ViewerStage.tsx`) -- both bump a counter rather than passing a boolean, so
 * two fits in a row (e.g. pressing F twice) each still trigger this effect
 * instead of coalescing into a no-op state-didn't-change skip.
 *
 * Frames the VISIBLE parts, not the whole assembly: `getVisibleBox` (see
 * `ModelViewer`) measures the world-space union of the visible parts' groups
 * at fit time -- with 1 of 11 parts checked, framing the full-assembly union
 * (which `Box3.expandByObject` would produce, since it ignores `.visible`)
 * renders that one part tiny in a huge frame, and a single-part pop-out
 * window opens absurdly zoomed-out. drei's `refresh(object?: Object3D |
 * Box3)` accepts the box directly (`if (isBox3(object)) box.copy(object)` in
 * `@react-three/drei/core/Bounds.js`). Computed INSIDE this layout effect,
 * not during render: React runs layout effects child-first and in sibling
 * order, and this component sits after `Resize` under `Bounds`, so
 * `Center`/`Resize` have already applied their position/scale by the time
 * the box is measured (and `getVisibleBox` bakes them into world space via
 * `updateWorldMatrix(true, true)`, same as drei's own Object3D path).
 * Falls back to the whole-scene measure when nothing visible has loaded
 * (`getVisibleBox` returns null), still guarded by `loadedCount > 0`:
 * fitting before anything has loaded would frame the `UNIT_BOX` fallback.
 *
 * This component is the ONLY fit driver -- `<Bounds>` below is mounted with
 * NO `fit`/`clip`/`observe` props, on purpose. drei's `Bounds` has an
 * internal layout effect (`Bounds.js` ~line 206: `if (observe ||
 * count.current++ === 0) { api.refresh(); if (fit) api.reset().fit(); if
 * (clip) api.clip(); }`, deps `[size, clip, fit, observe, camera,
 * controls]`) that re-runs whenever `state.controls` attaches -- and drei
 * `OrbitControls` registers itself via `makeDefault` in ITS OWN effect,
 * whose timing relative to part loads is a race. When the GLBs come from
 * the browser HTTP cache (every real revisit), parts resolve and this
 * component fits the tight visible box BEFORE the controls register; the
 * controls registration then re-triggered `Bounds`'s internal effect,
 * whose bare `api.refresh()` measured the FULL scene and `reset().fit()`
 * stomped the visible-parts framing with whole-assembly framing. On a cold
 * cache the order flips, which is why it looked correct on the vite dev
 * server and wrong against the container. With those three props removed,
 * that internal effect only ever does a harmless one-time `refresh()` (no
 * fit, no clip) -- do NOT re-add `observe` (or `fit`/`clip`) to `<Bounds>`;
 * it re-opens the race, and only on warm caches, so tests won't catch it.
 *
 * Replacing what `observe`/the controls re-run used to cover, two more
 * refit triggers live here instead, both via `useThree` so they land in
 * this effect's deps: `controls` (re-fit once the controls attach -- the
 * post-attach fit re-frames the visible box with the controls properly
 * targeted, closing the warm-cache race above from the other side) and
 * `size` (canvas resizes -- window resize, panel collapse/expand -- re-fit
 * the VISIBLE box, where `observe` would have framed the full assembly).
 *
 * Does NOT fire on a plain visibility toggle -- toggling a checked part
 * neither adds nor removes it from `loadedParts` nor bumps `fitSignal`, and
 * `getVisibleBox` is identity-stable (fully ref-based, see its definition),
 * so this intentionally does not run then; the NEXT fit (explicit or
 * load-driven) picks up the new visible set. */

          Deliberately NO `key` prop -- this used to be keyed on
          `loadedCount` + the visible id set to force a remount (and so a
          fresh `frames={1}` bake) on every part load/checkbox toggle, but
          drei 10.7.7's `ContactShadows` allocates two `WebGLRenderTarget`s
          plus depth/blur `ShaderMaterial`s imperatively in a `useMemo` with
          NO dispose path (no cleanup effect anywhere in
          `@react-three/drei/core/ContactShadows.js`, and the targets never
          appear in its JSX tree, so R3F can't auto-dispose them either) --
          every remount leaked ~2MB of GPU memory into this deliberately
          long-lived WebGL context, unbounded across checkbox toggles.

          Re-bakes still happen without the key: drei declares its bake
          frame counter as `let count = 0` in the component BODY (same
          file), so ANY re-render of `ContactShadows` resets it and the next
          invalidated frame re-runs the one-shot bake. Every event the key
          used to encode (a part load -> `loadedParts` state change; a
          visibility toggle -> `parts` prop change) re-renders `ModelViewer`
          and therefore this component, and the R3F prop commit invalidates
          a frame -- so the bake re-runs exactly when it must, with zero
          remounts. Stray re-renders re-baking too is harmless (a cheap
          one-shot 512^2 pass). If a drei upgrade ever memoizes that counter
          or moves it into a ref/state (i.e. "fixes" the body-reset quirk we
          intentionally rely on), stale shadows after a toggle are the
