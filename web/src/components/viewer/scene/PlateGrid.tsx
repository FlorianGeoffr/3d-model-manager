 *
 * LAYER TRAP (verified): `ContactShadows` (in ModelViewer.tsx) bakes by
 * swapping in `scene.overrideMaterial` and rendering the WHOLE scene from
 * its own shadow camera -- if the grid lived on the default layer (0, same
 * as everything else), it would get swept into that bake as a giant dark
 * blob covering the plate. Every object this module renders is therefore
 * pushed onto `GRID_LAYER` (1) via the `layers` prop (R3F resolves a
 * numeric `layers` prop by calling the target's `layers.set(...)`), and
 * `CameraLayers` enables that layer ONLY on the main viewing camera --
 * `ContactShadows`' shadow camera and the layer-0 raycaster used for
 * pointer hit-testing default to layer 0 only, so they never see the grid.
